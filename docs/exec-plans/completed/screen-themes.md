# Screen Themes

Status: implementation and final Simulator regression complete (2026-10-25).

## Completed phases

1. **Palette foundation:** Added typed theme identifiers and semantic color tokens, deterministic curated/custom palette resolution, contrast-aware color derivation, and resolver coverage for palette contrast, custom color extremes, input clamping, and migration behavior.
2. **Preferences and Settings:** Added per-user theme and custom-primary preferences, one-time migration from the existing accent setting, curated theme selection, and a custom color editor with preview.
3. **Screen integration:** Injected the selected palette from the root coordinator and applied semantic colors to Screen controls, focus outlines/glow, selection, sidebar, poster indicators, Details/Search/library surfaces, and playback UI. Retained the existing accent compatibility path for other callers.
4. **Regression verification:** Jamie reports that all final Screen Themes Simulator regression tests passed. The checkpoint request did not include the scenario matrix, device profile, or test logs; this record preserves the reported outcome without inferring additional coverage.

## Checkpoint and verification

- Theme implementation and related navigation/player work are recorded in commits `d2eba7e8` and `89aedf51`; shared files with intertwined changes stayed together. The local signing-team setting in `Swiftfin.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` remains machine-specific and is intentionally excluded from commits.
- SwiftFormat lint, Swift syntax parsing, the standalone Theme resolver checks, and `git diff --check` passed during commit preparation. SwiftLint exited successfully with 12 hard-coded-display-string warnings in pre-existing Play Next overlay labels.
- No Xcode build or additional Simulator test was run during commit preparation. The Simulator outcome remains user-reported as described above.

## Follow-up build repair (2026-10-25)

The first compile-only tvOS Simulator build found that color-selection assignments inside `SnowfinLibraryToolbarButtonStyle.makeBody` were interpreted as view-builder branches. Moving the palette selection into a regular helper that returns the fill/foreground pair fixed the compile error. The same `Snowfin tvOS` generic Simulator build then exited successfully; it did not install or launch the app.
